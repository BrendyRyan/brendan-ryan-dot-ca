This is my first blog post.

My name is Brendan Ryan. I am an accountant from Ontario Canada. I've been interested in web development for some time and finally feel confident enough to make my own website and publish some projects I have done while learning to code.

## Where I'm at

You may have seen the above graph of how much you _think_ you know versus how much you actually know. I find it interesting to consider where I am in respect to how much there is to know of a given subject. For interest, it's called the **Dunning-Kruger Effect**. I try to resist the urge to consider myself an expert after learning something for only a short amount of time. Competence takes time.

**Accounting and Excel** go hand-in-hand. I've worked on many Excel projects creating reuseable models for large-scale data analytics and tracking. I have created budgets, financial statements, external database queries, data maps between systems and more. Most recently I've gotten into VBA, however I'm in the very early stages and have much to learn.

I have typical experience with the other Office programs, and have opted to learn about Microsofts' **Power Platform** (Power BI, Power Apps, and Power Automate). Each has their use-case and are all enjoyable to use.

I have five years experience with Microsoft **Dynamics AX** and five years of
**Great Plains** and been deep in the weeds on both systems. I learned most of my SQL knowledge
from working with Great Plains, which led me to learning **Azure SQL** and subsequently PostgreSQL.

This led to learning **web development**. I started down the path in 2017 and took many detours.
After a rough start I landed on **Javascript**, and most recently, Svelte and Tailwind CSS. It
has been a challenging and rewarding experience learning to code. I've most recently started Typescript and look forward to learning more about it.
