  <h1>Hello there</h1>
  <p>Thanks for visiting.</p>
  <hr />
  <p>My name is Brendan Ryan. I'm a CPA from London, Ontario.</p>
  <p>
    Over the last few years I've really taken an interest in technology and web development. As an accountant, I've
    found that you can only be as good as the technology you're working with allows you to be. Therefore, I went on a
    journey to learn to code so one day I can create better programs to help accountants like me.
  </p>
  <p>
    Check out my blog post on my <a href="/blog/learning-to-code">learning to code journey</a> to learn more about the path
    I took to get to where I am now. I wouldn't necessarily recommend this path. Lacking any formal education in web development
    or computer science left me with internet blogs and social media comments to decide where to start. I've learned not
    to google "the best way to learn web development" anymore. You don't get very good advise from raging internet comments.

    I consider myself an advanced Excel user, and am pretty confident with Word, Outlook, and Powerpoint. I am familiar
    with Access but haven't built anything of great complexity with it.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've recently gotten into Power BI, which is a great aggregator of data with tremendous calculation power. As an
    accountant who constantly needs to get 'into the weeds' with data, looking at aggregations is not the most helpful,
    however I appreciate Power BI for what it is designed for
  </p>
  <p>
    I have intermediate knowledge of SQL, including Microsoft SQL Server and Postrgres. I can confidently setup
    databases, tables, schemas, naming conventions, and queries with complex joins. I have some experience with MongoDB
    as well.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have intermediate experience with Power Apps and Power Flow (formerly Power Automate) as well, through setting up
    auto-incrementors, form submissions triggers, and auto-email triggers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Most recently I've gotten into VBA, particularily on querying Dynamics 365 oData API for entity data. It has been a
    challenging project but was very helpful to me in learning about data strucures, and getting JSON to dump into Excel
    (rows and columns) cleanly.

    My next challenge will be trying to build an Excel add-in using the Javascript API. It will be an interesting
    challenge and I am looking forward to it.
